            At TraceXero, our BECCS process transforms Biomass into heat energy
          while efficiently capturing both CO₂ and Particulate Matter (PM)
          generated during combustion. Instead of releasing these emissions
          into the atmosphere, our advanced technology instantly captures
          them, preventing environmental harm.
          <br />
          The captured CO₂ is then decomposed into Graphitic Carbon and
          Oxygen. By effectively removing both CO₂ and PM, our closed-loop
          system not only supports renewable energy production but also
          converts waste into valuable resources, advancing global Net-Zero
          targets.
